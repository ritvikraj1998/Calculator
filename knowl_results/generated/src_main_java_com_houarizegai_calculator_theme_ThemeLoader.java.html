    <h1>Function name: loadThemes</h1>
    <h3><b>Input:</b></h3>
    <p>None</p>
    <h3><b>Output:</b></h3>
    <p>A map containing theme names as keys and Theme objects as values</p>
    <h3><b>Description:</b></h3>
    <p>This function loads themes from a YAML file and returns them as a map. Here's how it works:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>An <b>ObjectMapper</b> object named mapper is created with a <b>YAMLFactory</b> parameter. This object helps in reading and writing YAML data.</li>
        <li>The <b>findAndRegisterModules()</b> method is called on the mapper object to enable the discovery and registration of any available Jackson modules.</li>
        <li>A <b>try-catch</b> block is used to handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code inside the block.</li>
        <li>Within the <b>try</b> block, the <b>readValue()</b> method of the mapper object is called to read the YAML file located at "src/main/resources/application.yaml". The file is deserialized into a <b>ThemeList</b> object, which represents a list of themes.</li>
        <li>The <b>getThemesAsMap()</b> method is called on the themeList object to extract the themes as a map, where each theme is identified by its name.</li>
        <li>The extracted map is then returned as the output of the function.</li>
        <li>If an <b>IOException</b> occurs during the execution of the code inside the <b>try</b> block, an empty map is returned as the output.</li>
    </ol>
